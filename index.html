  <p>I'm a machine learning (ML) researcher working on a <a href="https://groups.cs.umass.edu/kdl/">PhD in computer 
    science</a> at UMass Amherst under Dr. David Jensen. Before I 
    joined UMass, I worked for Dr. Amy McGovern's <a href="http://mcgovern-fagg.org/idea/index.html">machine learning 
    lab</a> at the National Weather Center for four years. I also received
    my BS and MS in computer science from the University of Oklahoma. </p>

  <p>I've done several ML-focused internships at <a href="https://www.ll.mit.edu/">MIT Lincoln Laboratory</a>, one with the Air 
    Traffic Control Systems group and another with the Supercomputing Center. 
  </p>

  <p>My PhD work is supported by the <a href="https://www.umass.edu/graduate/inclusion/spaulding-smith-fellows">Spaulding-Smith Fellowship</a>, and I am a 
    2020 Google Scholarship recipient.
